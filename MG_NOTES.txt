## Notes about the app from debugging prcocess

# having trouble with the dynamic updating of the UI (Took it out and it works) 
# would like to just make it print something like thank you for the submission when it gets the data 

# make a column with the just the image filename not the path or extension. 

# how to let people acces via there phone (and submit iphone images)  

## counter.py problem (still works but want to fix)

/home/biouser/CRICKET_PROJECT/counter.py:77: SettingWithCopyWarning:
A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead


# Will want to make a the print and messages go to a log file.
